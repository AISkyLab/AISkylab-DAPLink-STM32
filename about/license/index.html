<p>﻿END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR MBED HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT   </p>
<p>THIS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT (“LICENCE”) IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (EITHER A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, OR SINGLE LEGAL ENTITY) AND ARM LIMITED ("ARM") FOR THE USE OF THE HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENCE. ARM IS ONLY WILLING TO LICENSE THE HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT TO YOU ON CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS LICENCE. BY INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING OR COPYING THE HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT YOU INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE, ARM IS UNWILLING TO LICENSE THE HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT TO YOU AND YOU MAY NOT INSTALL, USE OR COPY THE HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT.</p>
<p>“Hardware Development Kit” means the mbed board schematics (“Schematics”), and mbed data accompanying this Licence, and any printed, electronic or online documentation (“Documentation”) supplied with it..  </p>
<p>“Separate Files” means the separate files identified in the Schedule.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LICENCE GRANTS TO YOU.
1.1 SCHEMATICS AND DOCUMENTATION: ARM hereby grants you, subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, a revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licence to (i) use, copy, and modify the Schematics and Documentation to design, manufacture and have manufactured mbed enabled microcontroller development boards, provided that such mbed enabled microcontroller development boards contain microprocessor(s) manufactured by the designated silicon vendor (as specified in the Documentation and Schematics) under a licence from ARM; and (ii) distribute (directly or through your customers and authorised distributors) the Schematics and Documentation (including any modified versions of the Schematics and Documentation created under the licences granted in Clause 1.1(i)) , provided you agree to: (a) distribute the unmodified Schematics and Documentation subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence; (b) include prominent notices if you have modified the Schematics and Documentation; (c) preserve any  notices, including copyright notices, which are included in the Schematics and Documentation; (d) not use ARM’s logos or trade marks to market the Schematics and Documentation (including any modified versions of the Schematics and Documentation created under the licences in Clause 1.1(i)) or your design of an mbed enabled microcontroller development board created under the licences granted in Clause 1.1(i) without ARM’s prior consent; and (e) ensure your customers and authorised distributors comply with this Clause 1.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COPYRIGHT AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS: The Hardware Development Kit is owned by ARM or its licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. The Hardware Development Kit is licensed not sold. You acquire no rights to the Hardware Development Kit other than as expressly provided by this Licence. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You shall not remove from the Hardware Development Kit this Licence, any copyright notice or other notice and shall ensure that the Licence and any such notice is reproduced in any copies of the whole or any part of the Hardware Development Kit made by you.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SUPPORT.
ARM is under no obligation to provide you with any support, but it may do so at its sole discretion.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO  WARRANTIES

</li>
</ol>
<p>ARM does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury arising from ARM's negligence or ARM’s fraud and because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages the above limitation relating to liability for consequential damages may not apply to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.
